# Regression-Models
This repository contains example projects using various regression techniques including simple linear, multiple linear, polynomial, lasso, ridge, elastic net using statsmodels and scikit learn models including decision tree and ensemble regressors. There are also neural network models using Tensorflow (Keras) and Pytorch.

# Projects:
* Advertising spend to predict sales
* Automobile miles per gallon and exam scores predictions models
* Automobile price prediction using PYTORCH NN Model
* Blood pressure prediction
* California house price prediction
* Ensemble Regressor - this is a notebook containing both regression and classification models. Scroll to view ensemble regressors including , bagging and pasting with replacement, Random Forest and Adaboost used to predict the strength of concrete.
* Multiple Project Notebook - this notebook contains multiple ML techniques. See models 1 & 2 in this notebook - Boston house price and diamond price predictions.
* Multiple Project Notebook2 - this notebook contains multiple ML techniques:
* - sales spend prediction based on tv, newspaper and radio advertising (same dataset as above)
* - insurance charges based on customer features using ensemble regression (bagging regressor and gradient boosting regressor)
* Taxi fare prediction using PYTORCH NN model
* Zillow house price prediction and salary predictions
